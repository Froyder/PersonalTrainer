# 💪 Personal Trainer

A cross-platform fitness app built with **Kotlin Multiplatform** and **Compose Multiplatform**, running natively on both Android and iOS from a single shared codebase.

The app uses AI to generate personalized workout plans, tracks progress, and adapts over time based on the user's goals and performance.

## Key Engineering Decisions

**Single shared UI** — Compose Multiplatform for all screens. Platform-specific code is limited to `expect/actual` declarations for system APIs (notifications, network, date formatting, URL opening).

**Local-first with remote sync** — Data loads instantly from local storage (Multiplatform Settings), then syncs from Firestore in the background. No loading spinners on app launch for returning users.

**AI prompt engineering** — Gemini receives a structured prompt with user profile data and returns a strict JSON schema. The response is parsed and validated before display. Includes retry logic and quota error handling.

**Theme system** — Five `ColorScheme` presets defined as Material3 `lightColorScheme`/`darkColorScheme` pairs. Selected scheme is persisted and resolved at the root `MaterialTheme` level, so every composable automatically reflects changes.

**Notification scheduling** — Per-day alarms using actual workout schedule (not daily). Alarms are rescheduled weekly after firing, and persist across device reboots via `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast on Android.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Ladybug or later
- Xcode 15+ (for iOS)
- JDK 17
- CocoaPods (`gem install cocoapods`)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Froyder/PersonalTrainer.git
cd PersonalTrainer
```

2. **Add your API keys**

Create `local.properties` in the project root:
```properties
gemini_api_key=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
```
Get a free Gemini API key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)

3. **Add Firebase config files**
- Place `google-services.json` in `composeApp/`
- Place `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `iosApp/iosApp/`

Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) with:
- Authentication (Email/Password enabled)
- Firestore Database

4. **Install iOS dependencies**
```bash
cd iosApp
pod install
```

5. **Run**
- **Android** — open in Android Studio, run on device/emulator
- **iOS** — open `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode, run on simulator

## What I Learned

This project was built as a deep dive into Kotlin Multiplatform in a real-world context. Key takeaways:

- **KMP maturity** — The ecosystem is production-ready for business logic and networking. Compose Multiplatform for UI is solid on Android and iOS, with some platform quirks around system APIs.
- **expect/actual** — Powerful but requires discipline. Keeping platform implementations thin and pushing logic into `commonMain` is the right approach.
- **Firebase on KMP** — The gitlive-firebase wrapper works well but iOS requires CocoaPods integration, which adds friction to the build setup.
- **Compose state management** — Single source of truth via `StateFlow` + `collectAsState()` scales cleanly across a multi-screen app.
- **AI integration** — Prompt engineering matters. Strict JSON schema instructions and response cleaning (stripping markdown fences) are essential for reliable parsing.
